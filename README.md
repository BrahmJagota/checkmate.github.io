## To-do list
1. Implement MongoDB system database for login saves.
2. Request for beta testers.
3. Fix current bugs (view issues tab)

## Tools of the Trade
Hosted on Vercel, Checkmate has implemented the Tailwind framework to help with mobile styling and code efficiency. Moreover, the website will soon use nextJS and mongoDB as a database to save data and logins!
